README for the libregeek-archive-keyring package
=============================================

Introduction
------------

The SteamOS-Tools project signs its Release files that are 
stored on the Libregeek repository (packages.libregeek.org), and its mirrors with 
the keys contained in this package.

A quick overview about this package:

* Each actively used key is placed in /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/ to
  be used by "apt" and its apt-key command in versions 0.6 and later.
  The signatures of acquired Release files are checked against this
  key database. It hence contains all keys of all releases that
  are still supported and need to be active.
* /usr/share/keyrings/libregeek-archive-keyring.gpg:
  A keyring including all actively used keys to sign Release files in
  our supported releases is shipped in /usr/share/keyrings.

More information about the archive authentication feature can be found
in the manpage apt-secure(8).
